## Usage
1. Download the package to a local folder (e.g. ~/OLTC-changer/) by running:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/letfritz/OLTC-changer.git
   ```
2. Run OpenDSS and navigate to the folder (~/OLTC-changer/), then run the Run_8500Node_Unbal.dss script.
3. Change the cases as many times as you want in the Master-unbal.dss file.

## üìù About this Project
In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on diversifying and decarbonizing the energy matrix, paving the way for the emergence of new energy technologies as promising solutions for sustainable development. Among the emerging energies 
that have already achieved commercial maturity and deployment in Brazil are photovoltaic panels. This work proposes to analyze the potential impacts of on-load TAP-changers (OLTC) in transformers in industries located in distribution networks 
with a signiÔ¨Åcant presence of photovoltaic distributed generation (PVDG). Thus, three industries are strategically allocated at different points of the IEEE 8500-node system using the OpenDSS program. The impacts are evaluated in several PVDG 
penetration scenarios in the network. The results show substantial Ô¨Çuctuations in the Ô¨Çow of energy generated by PVDG within the low-voltage network. This, in turn, induces frequent voltage changes in the medium-voltage network, leading to 
an increased operational frequency of OLTCs and a subsequent reduction in their lifetime. Moreover, this paper proposes alternative conÔ¨Ågurations for voltage regulator devices to enhance their lifetime in the face of intermittent voltage variations. 
The results suggest that adjusting the equipment‚Äôs actuation delay and bandwidth of the OLTCs can decrease the OLTC switching frequency in a range of 65‚Äì85%, resulting in the preservation of the equipment‚Äôs lifetime.
